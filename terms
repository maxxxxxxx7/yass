	<p>Welcome to Yass. Yass is an app to compliment your friends. We hope that Yass shows you that there are people who love and admire you.</p>
	<p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern access and use of our app, website, and other tools (collectively, “Yass” or the “Service” or “Services”). Each time you access or use Yass, you agree to be bound by these Terms and any additional terms that apply to you. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, please stop using Yass.

	<p>We also have a Privacy Policy that discusses what information we collect and how we use this information. You should read the Privacy Policy because it governs the Company’s use of your personal information.</p>
	<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: THE SECTION TITLED “ARBITRATION AND GOVERNING LAW” CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS-ACTION WAIVER THAT APPLIES TO ALL YASS USERS. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
